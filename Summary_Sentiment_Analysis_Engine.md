The code can be divided into the following sections:

Section 1: Importing Libraries and Corpuses
- This section imports the necessary libraries and corpuses required for text processing and analysis. It includes the following imports:
  - `re` for regular expressions
  - `TextBlob` from the `textblob` library for sentiment analysis
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` for visualization
  - `pandas` as `pd` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
  - `nltk.tokenize` for tokenization
  - `nltk.stem` for lemmatization
  - `nltk.corpus` for accessing stopwords

Section 2: Reading the CSV File
- This section reads a CSV file named 'tweets.csv' into a pandas DataFrame object called `tweet_df`.
- It also renames the column 'message to examine' to 'tweets' using the `rename()` function.
- The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed using the `head()` function.
- Two variables, `NoOfTerms` and `searchTerm`, are assigned values.

Section 3: Cleaning Data
- This section defines several data cleaning functions and applies them to the 'cleaned_data' column of the DataFrame.
- The cleaning functions perform the following tasks:
  - `clean_data()` removes URLs, special characters, and mentions from the text.
  - `drop_numbers()` removes words containing numbers from the text.
  - `lower_case()` converts all words to lowercase.
  - `lemmatise()` lemmatizes the words in the text.
  - `remove_stopword()` removes stopwords from the text.
- Each cleaning function is applied using the `apply()` function on the 'cleaned_data' column of the DataFrame.

Section 4: Finding Polarity
- This section calculates the polarity of the cleaned text using the TextBlob library.
- The `get_polarity()` function categorizes the polarity into different sentiment categories: neutral, weakly positive, positive, strongly positive, weakly negative, negative, and strongly negative.
- The `get_polarity()` function is applied to the 'cleaned_data' column using the `apply()` function, and the results are stored in the 'polarity' column of the DataFrame.

Section 5: Report
- This section generates a report based on the polarity analysis.
- It calculates the percentage of tweets in each sentiment category.
- It also prints a general report indicating the overall sentiment based on the polarity value.
- The detailed report shows the percentage breakdown of different sentiment categories.

Section 6: Visual Representation
- This section creates a pie chart using matplotlib to visually represent the sentiment distribution.
- It uses the percentage values calculated in the previous section to determine the sizes and labels of the pie chart segments.
- The pie chart is displayed using the `plt.show()` function.
